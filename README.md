# Improving Collaboration by Integrating Multiple Tools

## Project Overview

This project aims to enhance team collaboration by integrating various development and communication tools into a unified workflow. By streamlining processes and automating tasks, teams can work more efficiently and effectively.

## Features

- **Tool Integration**: Combines multiple platforms to create a seamless workflow.
- **Automation**: Reduces manual tasks through automated processes.
- **Scalability**: Designed to grow with your team's needs.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)
- [Kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/)
- [eksctl](https://eksctl.io/)

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Chethans18/IMPROVING-COLLABORATION-BY-INTEGRATING-MULTIPLE-TOOLS.git
cd IMPROVING-COLLABORATION-BY-INTEGRATING-MULTIPLE-TOOLS
```
````

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

## Running the Application Locally

To start the application on your local machine:

```bash
node app.js
```

The application should now be running at `http://localhost:3000/`.

## Dockerization

To containerize the application using Docker:

### 1. Build the Docker Image

```bash
docker build -t my-node-app .
```

### 2. Run the Docker Container

```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 my-node-app
```

## Deployment to AWS

To deploy the application on AWS using Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS):

### 1. Authenticate AWS CLI

```bash
aws configure
```

### 2. Create EKS Cluster

```bash
eksctl create cluster --name my-cluster --region us-east-1 --nodegroup-name my-nodes --node-type t3.micro --nodes 2
```

### 3. Deploy to Kubernetes

- Apply Kubernetes configurations:

  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
  ```

- Verify the deployment:

  ```bash
  kubectl get services
  ```

## Continuous Integration and Deployment

This project utilizes GitHub Actions for CI/CD. The workflow is defined in `.github/workflows/main.yml` and includes steps for building, testing, and deploying the application.

## Load Testing

To test the deployed application, use Apache Bench:

```bash
ab -n 1000 -c 100 http://<EKS_LoadBalancer_IP>/
```
